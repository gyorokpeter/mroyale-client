  <h1>Version 1.0.1</h1>
  2019-06-16 - Performance Patch<br>
  Player count reduced to 75 from 99<br>
  <div class='note'>
  Both the server and the game client struggle to handle a full 99 players so I'm reducing it for now to help alleviate performance issues on both the backend server and the client renderer.<br>
  I also feel like 99 players is a bit overly chaotic right at the start, so hopefully this will make it more manageable.<br>
  After all... Most battle royales spread their players over a large area. This game dumps them all in 1 place.
  </div>
  Renderer culling changes<br>
  <div class='note'>Small change to slightly improve framerates.</div>
  Experimental Server Performance Improvements<br>
  <div class='note'>Made some changes to how the server writes game data to clients. Should be thread safe but may cause problems. I'll roll this back if it breaks things.</div>
